# Hospital Management System

Hospital Management System is a C++ application that utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage various aspects of a hospital, including patients, doctors, appointments, feedback, and payments. The system supports distinct user roles for administrators, doctors, and regular users.
